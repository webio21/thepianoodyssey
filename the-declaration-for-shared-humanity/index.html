    <h1>The Declaration for Shared Humanity</h1>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="the-declaration-for-shared-humanity.jpg" width="1024" height="576"></p>
  
  <main>
    <p><strong>We, the witnesses of capitalism’s golden illusions and its darkest costs—</strong><br>
    the generation born into promise, yet awakened in crisis—<br>
    solemnly declare: In a time when the concentration of wealth threatens humanity, democracy, and our future,<br>
    we have a responsibility to redefine the boundaries of ownership and the justice of distribution.</p>

    <p>It’s not that people are inherently selfish—it’s that injustice in distribution forces them to be.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we propose the establishment of a <strong>Global Wealth Staircase Tax</strong>—<br>
    A progressive, multi-tiered wealth tax designed to fund universal equity and unleash global innovation—<br>
    A foundational bridge toward the transformation of human civilization.<br>
    A system that will no longer let the 1% hold the wealth of the 99%.<br>
    A system that will once again unleash the creative potential and hope of all people.</p>

    <div class="tax-table">
      <p><strong>Over $100 million:</strong> 1% annual tax<br>
      <strong>Over $1 billion:</strong> 10% annual tax<br>
      <strong>Over $10 billion:</strong> 90% annual tax</p>
    </div>

    <p>These resources can be redirected to fund housing, education, healthcare, and citizen equity, and to support the entrepreneurial dreams of all people.</p>

    <p>This policy applies only to wealth accumulated after its implementation,<br>
    ensuring the protection of existing fortunes while enabling the fair redistribution of future wealth.</p>

    <p><strong>Humanity has never been great.<br>
    What will make it truly great?</strong><br>
    Not just a savior, nor a system—<br>
    but the independent awakening of minds—<br>
    collective, multiplied.</p>

    <p>We also recognize that such a transformation cannot begin with the powerful alone.</p>

    <p>If we wait for existing politicians and billionaires to lead this change as a gift, we risk waiting forever.</p>

    <p><strong>This proposal must begin with the people</strong>—from those who still believe that a better system is possible.</p>
