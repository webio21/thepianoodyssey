<p><b>Social platforms were meant to unite minds, not monetize them.</b><br>
The Insights Engine is not here to entertain—it exists to elevate.<br>
In a world flooded by noise, this is a platform for signal. For substance. For solutions.<br>
No ads. No manipulation. No celebrity bias.<br>
Just people sharing real insights, offering real value, and building a more intelligent future together.<br>
This is what social media should have been all along—and finally is.</p>

  <h2>Ten Unasked Questions — <span style="font-weight: normal;">Examples for Your Inspiration</span></h2>

  <ol style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
    <li>
      <strong>Why do outdated systems still survive, even when everyone knows they’re broken?</strong><br>
      From tax filings to permit applications, forms repeat, queues stretch, time is bled.<br>
      Are these rituals protected by tradition, or tolerated by exhaustion?
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why take ten steps to do what one could in one?</strong><br>
      When simplicity is suppressed, someone profits from the complexity.
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why must consumers pay for design flaws?</strong><br>
      Labels that won’t peel. Tags that scratch. Tables that injure.<br>
      These aren’t accidents. They are symptoms of a numb civilization.
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why is logging into a website harder than entering a room?</strong><br>
      Is “security” there to protect users—or to farm them as training data for machines?
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why do we need tools to open modern packaging?</strong><br>
      When a box demands a blade, and plastic needs scissors—<br>
      is this indifference from brands, or humiliation for the buyer?
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why wait at a red light with no cars in sight?</strong><br>
      Were traffic systems meant to serve us, or to condition us?<br>
      Are smart roads too costly to replace an outdated excuse?
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why do humans surrender their weekends to mowing lawns?</strong><br>
      Is this ritual of trimming neat grass a symbol of order, or a worship of wasted labor?
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why is education obsessed with test scores, not inspiration?</strong><br>
      Creativity can’t be graded—so it’s treated as useless.
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why must sirens scream across entire cities?</strong><br>
      Has noise become the language of civilization?<br>
      Are screaming engines symbols of progress—or failures of empathy?
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <strong>Why do we treat the Earth like a thing, not a home?</strong><br>
      People mine it, burn it, poison it—then call it “resources.”<br>
      If a home is where life begins, why did we choose to end it here?
    </li>
  </ol>
