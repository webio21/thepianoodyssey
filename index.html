<h2 style="font-size: 2.5em; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 10px;">Description</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This is not a science fiction novel—it's a blueprint for civilization’s second chance. A revolt beyond utility.</p>

<p>In a universe bound by unbreakable laws, one man has found the key to rewriting reality itself.</p>

<p>Neosun was never meant to exist—at least, not in this timeline. A brilliant but discarded mind, he spent his life chasing forbidden truths, reaching beyond the limits of human understanding. But the world had no patience for dreamers, and the universe had no mercy for those who dared to defy its design.</p>

<p>Broke. Isolated. Forgotten. His stomach was empty, his future a dead end. Lonely, powerless, and desperate, he made a final, reckless gamble—plunging into Framequark, the enigmatic realm where he picked up the torch of childhood innocence that humanity had carelessly discarded. That fragile flame, now on the brink of extinction, flickered against the winds of indifference.</p>

<p>Framequark.<br>
An anomaly in the fabric of existence. A force capable of reshaping time itself. And within it, he discovered the final equation—a truth so profound it could fracture the present, resurrect the past, and create infinite futures.</p>

<p>But some things were never meant to be known. Forces that feed on entropy have begun to hunt him. The world fears what it cannot control. And at the heart of it all, one question lingers:</p>

<p>If you could defy time, would you fix what was lost… or forge something greater?</p>

<p>A mind-bending fusion of hard science fiction, philosophical depth, and high-stakes suspense, <i>The Piano Odyssey</i> is an electrifying exploration of free will, grief, and the cost of ultimate knowledge.</p>

<p>For readers who loved the metaphysical ambition of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and the emotional depth of <i>Solaris</i>, <i>The Piano Odyssey</i> offers a lyrical yet rigorous journey into time, memory, and synthetic consciousness.</p><br>

<p><b>Part I: Starman<span style="font-weight: normal;"><i> — What The Hell Is God Doing?</i></span></b></p>

<p style="color:#ff4629;">📖 > <a href="preview-part2.html">Preview</a></p>

<p>The Earth had become a paradise not for people,<br>
but for the oligarchs and tyrants who had perfected the art of human exploitation.</p>

<p>After a series of civilizational reforms on Earth ended in utter collapse,<br>
Neosun turned away in silence—choosing a path no one else could see.</p>

<p><i>Life systems should not continue to run like a cruel program—<br>
it violates the aesthetics of true civilization.</i></p>

<p>So Neosun set a bottom line for the new civilization: only vegetarians would be admitted.<br>
He and this group boarded a ship and fled Earth, seeking a way of life grounded in ethical clarity.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of ruin, he secretly nurtured a new experimental base—<br>
one built for the next kind of humanity.</p>

<p>Their heightened empathic perception made them deeply compassionate,<br>
yet also painfully vulnerable. They would rather endure personal sacrifice than let others suffer.<br>
To traditional societies, they were seen as anti-human aberrations—threats to the natural order.<br>
But to the vegetarians, the traditionalists were pitiable animals,<br>
trapped in a machinery of normalized violence.</p>

<p>Eventually, conflict broke out between them and those left on Earth—<br>
moralists who mouthed ethics like cud, only to digest and defecate it into hollow dogmas.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t violence that determined the outcome.<br>
In the end, it was an advanced species from another world,<br>
beings of elegant indifference, who made humanity’s collective apathy pay its ultimate price.</p>

<p>On an artificial planet orbiting in silence,<br>
he established first contact with… another kind of mind.</p>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
      <div class="review-text">“For those of us accustomed to tradition, who is truly the mad one? A hauntingly beautiful meditation on time, memory, and the human drive to defy cosmic limitations, moral boundaries, and ethical norms. The blend of hard science and metaphysical emotion is simply breathtaking, as the narrative boldly challenges the boundaries of nature and consciousness.” — Sarah K.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
      <div class="review-text">“The concept of The Piano Odyssey is incredibly intriguing. The use of hidden melodies as a puzzle woven throughout the novel is a brilliantly creative touch. Neosun is the kind of protagonist who stays with you—deeply intelligent, tragically flawed, and emotionally raw. I'm sure Nina is still alive. It's clear that this is a work that transcends existing classics. I highly recommend you read it, even though I rarely read science fiction myself. A masterpiece of character and concept.” — Julian P.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
      <div class="review-text">“The Piano Odyssey reads like 2001: A Space Odyssey merged with the emotional soul of Solaris. Philosophically potent and narratively intimate.” — Malcolm T.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★☆</div>
      <div class="review-text">“Framequark theory is the most original sci-fi concept I’ve read in a decade. The emotional core adds a rare vulnerability to such high-concept storytelling.” — Aisha R.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
      <div class="review-text">“The novel’s romantic arc adds surprising depth to its philosophical core. I didn’t expect to cry while reading about sci-fi novel, but in chapter 34, I did” — Emiko L.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
      <div class="review-text">“When I first read the version the author shared with me, I was deeply drawn to Neosun’s spirit of challenging the impossible. It was truly an honor to be a beta reader for such a remarkable novel. Every sentence feels sculpted with precision and heart.” — Victor M.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★☆☆☆</div>
      <div class="review-text">“What the hell is God doing? That has always been a question of mine, even though I'm not a believer. The reason I'm not satisfied with this book is that it doesn't explain what God is doing, but I still look forward to reading the second part.” — Tom M.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
      <div class="review-text">“There are echoes of Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Egan, and even Borges in here—but what this story achieves is utterly unique.” — Louisa D.</div>
